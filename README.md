# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Predictor (Equity-Based)

This is a Java-based project that predicts stock prices for equity markets using historical data. It processes data like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Turnover to provide short-term and long-term forecasts.

The predictor is built using core Java, data structures, and basic mathematical logic. It does not rely on external ML libraries, making it lightweight and fully customizable. The project uses gradient descent techniques to fine-tune internal weights and improve accuracy over time.

Ideal for learning how stock prediction works without heavy machine learning frameworks.
